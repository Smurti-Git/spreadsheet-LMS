Implementation Considerations
üîπ Initially, Google Sheets can act as a database, with Google Apps Script handling automation. üîπ As the LMS scales, Firebase or MySQL/PostgreSQL can replace Sheets for structured data management. üîπ Google AppSheet is a no-code option if you want a simplified UI while still using Sheets. üîπ Authentication can be done via Google Sign-In or Firebase Authentication for secure logins.

This approach ensures flexibility while keeping things scalable. Would you like suggestions on the best tools and frameworks for implementation? I can also help draft a step-by-step plan for transitioning from Google Sheets to a DBMS!
